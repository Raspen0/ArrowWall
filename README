ArrowWall

Plugin developer:

Description:
--------------------
Summon a huge wall of arrows towards your enemies!


Usage:
--------------------
/aw [arrowsToSpawn]

(The amount of arrows to spawn is optional, it will spawn 10 by default. 
The plugin is hard limited to 500 arrows at a time due to horrible lag.
After 5 seconds, the spawned arrows will be removed to improve performance.)


Permissions Node:

Without the great example of your awesome plugins, 
this wouldn't have been possible.
