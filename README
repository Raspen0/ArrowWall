Description:
--------------------
Summon a huge wall of arrows towards your enemies!


Usage:
--------------------
/aw [arrowsToSpawn] - spawns an amount of arrows in the direction you face
/fw [arrowsToSpawn] - spawns flaming arrows
/awreload - reloads configuration

(The amount of arrows to spawn is optional, it will spawn 10 without an explicit parameter.
By default, after 5 seconds, the spawned arrows will be removed to improve performance.)
